### Important information

If you are thinking of contacting us, please do not e-mail the author to ask for download instructions, installation guidelines, or the simulator itself. The simulator itself is well-documented and provides the essential information about the code. Note that we will NOT help to debug user-generated code that was not included in the provided software package. If, however, you notice a bug in our code, please be so kind to contact the Author.

If you find simulator (or parts of it) helpful for your publication, please kindly cite our paper:

[1] N. T. Nguyen, M. Ma, N. Shlezinger, Y. C. Eldar, A. L. Swindlehurst, and M. Juntti, “Deep unfolding hybrid beamforming designs for THz massive MIMO systems,” arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.12041, 2023.[Online]. Available:https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12041.



# How to start a simulation
Download the whole project to your local worksation.
## Block-box unsupervised CNN for hybrid beamformining design
Run the 'BB_main.py' in the file *BB_CNN_unsupervised* and you will get the data that can be compared to other schemes.

## Deep unfolding for  hybrid beamformining design
Run the 'main.py' in the file *Deep_unfolding* and you will get the data that can be compared to other schemes.



The simulator runs with predefined parameters. You can specify your own system and simulation parameters. More details about the parameters are suggestted to read the paper. 

We highly recommend you to execute the code step-by-step (using PyCharm's debug mode) in order to get a detailed understanding of the simulator.
